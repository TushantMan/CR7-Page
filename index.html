              Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro born 5 February 1985 is a
              Portuguese professional footballer who plays as a forward for
              Serie A club Juventus and captains the Portugal national team.
              Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded
              as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five
              Ballon d'Or awards and four European Golden Shoes, both of which
              are records for a European player. He has won 32 major trophies in
              his career, including seven league titles, five UEFA Champions
              Leagues, one UEFA European Championship, and one UEFA Nations
              League title. Ronaldo holds the records for the most international
              goals (109, tied with Ali Daei), the most goals in the Champions
              League (134) and the most goals in the European Championship (14).
              He is one of the few recorded players to have made over 1,100
              professional career appearances and has scored over 780 official
              senior career goals for club and country.

            <p>
              Ronaldo signed with English powerhouse Manchester United in 2003.
              He was an instant sensation and soon came to be regarded as one of
              the best forwards in the game. His finest season with United came
              in 2007–08, when he scored 42 League and Cup goals and earned the
              Golden Shoe award as Europe’s leading scorer, with 31 League
              goals. After helping United to a Champions League title in May
              2008, Ronaldo captured Fédération Internationale de Football
              Association (FIFA) World Player of the Year honours for his
              stellar 2007–08 season.

              Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a record £80 million transfer fee.
              His scoring prowess continued with his new team, and he netted 40
              goals during the 2010–11 season and in 2011–12 Ronaldo helped
              Madrid capture a La Liga championship and scored a personal-best
              46 goals during the League season. He scored a total of 66 goals
              in 56 appearances with Madrid and the Portugal in 2013 to earn his
              second Ballon d’Or award. In 2014 he scored 52 goals in 43 games

              another Ballon d’Or award. In 2014–15 he netted 48 goals to lead

              Cristiano Ronaldo joined Juventus on 10 Jul 2018. Despite being 36
              years, Ronaldo has kept his pace in terms of goal scoring. While
              the 2018-19 debut season had been quite poor in terms of goal
              scoring for Ronaldo with 28 goals and 11 assists in 43 games in
              all competitions. He still managed to win Serie A and Supercoppa
              Italiana in his first season at Juventus. The 2019-20 season
              proved to be better in terms of goal scoring with 37 goals and 7
              assists in 46 games in all competitions. In terms of silverware
              juventus won their 9 Serie A title in a row with Ronaldo adding
              second to his tally. The 2020-21 season was the best in terms of
              goal scoring with 36 goals and 4 assists in 44 games with Ronaldo
              winning the Serie A Top Scorer Award. The club failed to win Serie
              A for first time in 9 years but still managed to win Coppa Italia
              and Supercoppa Italiana

              Ronaldo had made his first appearance for Portugal’s full national
              team against Kazakhstan in August 2003. He was a key player in
              Portugal’s fourth-place finish at the 2006 World Cup and became
              the full-time captain of the national team in 2008. In 2012 his
              stellar play led Portugal to the semifinals of the European
              Championship, where his team was eliminated by rival Spain in a
              match that was decided by a penalty kick shoot-out. Ronaldo came
              into the 2014 World Cup hot off of his second world player of the
              year win, but his play at the tournament was spotty, and the
              entire Portugal team struggled during a group-stage elimination.
              In 2016 he helped Portugal win the European Championship, the
              country’s first major international tournament title, although he
              only played sparingly in the final because of a knee injury that
              he had sustained early in the match. Ronaldo played brilliantly at
              the 2018 World Cup, scoring four goals in four games as Portugal
              advanced to the knockout. In the Euro 2020 portugal were drawn
              into Group F called the Group of Death with teams like France,
              Germany, Hungary and Protugal.Euro 2020 start was great for
              Ronaldo with scoring in every Group Stage Game against all 3
              opponents and breaking the Euro all time Goal scoring record.

              Ronaldo is a versatile goal scorer who likes to cut in from the
              left wing and shoot with his favorite right foot. Ronaldo’s
              heading ability is beyond what most players can achieve. It’s also
              important to note that Ronaldo’s weaker foot is better than
              Messi’s weaker foot. Ronaldo’s ability is also exceptional in
              taking free kicks, but over the years Messi’s technique has gotten
              better. When it comes to taking penalties however, Ronaldo has
              proved to be more superior; always calmer and more composed to
              score even in the most demanding times from the spot kick. <br />
              Over the years, Ronaldo has also changed their styles of play to
              adapt to new teams and connect better with new teammates. For
              example, At Manchester United, Ronaldo wasn’t primarily a goal
              scorer as he’s in Real Madrid now. At United, Ronaldo was an
              all-around player who frequently dropped to his own half to pick
              up the ball and orchestrate an attack. He often mesmerized us by
              his breathtaking long range shots from outside the box. His
              dribbling skills were almost at bar as he tried find his way
              through packed spaces in the mid-field. In fact some strong fans
              of the Portuguese international still prefer ‘The Ronaldo at
              Manchester United.’<br />
              At Real Madrid, Ronaldo’s role has gradually been reduced over
              time to goal scoring. As such, scoring goals has been a major way
              for Ronaldo to prove his credibility in the current game, and
              fairly enough, his resiliency has made him blossom in this role.
              The number of goals he has scored since switching to Real Madrid
              speak for themselves.
